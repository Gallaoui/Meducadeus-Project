# Meducadeus-Project
This project builded using unity UI Builder - Firebase - Photon PUN 2

if you face Some problems with UIDocements errors, that's mean u need to upgrade the " version control " package from Packages Manager

After, you need to add "FirebaseCppApp-8_8_0.so" to "Assets\Firebase\Plugins\x86_64" repository due to git size limits.
